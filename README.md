* Design Notes:
*
* This code uses a random number between 0 and and the defined count
* to select between 10 defined effects for two high brightness LEDs.
*
* This has been designed to use two high brightness white light LEDs in order to
make the effect
* more intense but you can operate with one of you choose.
*
* I have purposely left room for a lot of growth and improvement on this project,
have fun!

* Circuit Pinout:
* PIN 1.0 = Anode of LED #1 > Cathode to Ground
* PIN 1.1 = UNASSIGNED - UART
* PIN 1.2 = UNASSIGNED - UART
* PIN 1.3 = Anode of LED #2 > Cathode to Ground
* PIN 1.4 = UNASSIGNED
* PIN 1.5 = UNASSIGNED
* PIN 1.6 = UNASSIGNED
* PIN 1.7 = UNASSIGNED

UNDERSTANDING YOUR COMPONENTS:
------------------------------
What is an Anode and a Cathode?
Imagine the image below is an LED
/\
||
--
|| An LED as two leads that come off of it, one long and one short.
|| The long Lead is the ANODE and the short one is the CATHODE, on many LEDS
you will notice the LED has a flat edge on one side and a
| rounded edge on the other. The flat side is the CATHODE
What is VCC and GND Mean?
VCC is your (POSITIVE Voltage +) connection
GND is your (NEGATIVE - or GROUND) connection

PREPARING YOUR MSP430 LAUNCHPAD FOR THIS PROJECT:
-------------------------------------------------
No Special Preparation Required
____________________________________________________________________________________
CONNECTING YOUR MSP430 LAUNCHPAD TO THE LEDS:
---------------------------------------------
Connect the Anode of one of LEDs to PIN 1.0 and the Cathode to GND
Connect the Anode of the other LED to PIN 1.3 and the Cathode to GND
If you wish for the welder effect to not be as intense, only use the one LED
